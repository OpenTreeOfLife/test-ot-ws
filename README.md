# Open Tree integration tests

This repository holds integration tests, intended to answer the
question, is a new version of the web site good enough to go to
production?

## History of this repo
This code was previously in the [germinator](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/germinator)
    repository with the individual tests spread out across each of
    the implementation repositories and peyotl as a prerequisite.
The goal of this refactoring was for the test repository for integration tests
    to be standalone and easier to use.
